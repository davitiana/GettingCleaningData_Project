===========================

Please read this to find out how the script in this repository works.

The script "run_analysis.R" should be located at the same directory as the data folder "UCI HAR Dataset". This data folder 
is the first sub-folder once the "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip" is unzipped.
